### Data Structures and Algorithms from sratch.

I am redoing everything from ground up. The purpose is to implement data structures in C and in the process learn to steer through the varied challenges and become a better programmer. 

I will be writing (most) Data Structures in C and Algorithms in C++ using STL so that the algorithm can be used as a template later on.
 
This will serve as a reference material for me (and others).

List of Data Structures:

_1. Stack_
_2. Queue_
_3. Linked List_
_4. Hash Table_
_5. Binary Search Tree (has Binary Tree implementation and various traversals)_ 
_6. Binary Heap (heapify)_
7. Minimum stack / Minimum queue
7. Fenwick Tree
8. Segment Tree
9. Disjoint-set (Union Find data structure)
10. B-Tree
11. B+ Tree
12. Graph (using adjacency list)

List Of Algorithms:

_1. Heapify (for binary heap)_
_2. Preorder Traversal (in Binary Tree)_
_3. Inorder Traversal (in Binary Tree)_
_4. Postorder Traversal (in Binary Tree)_
5. Binary Search
6. Level order Traversal (in Binary Tree, N-ary Tree)
7. Breadth First Search (BFS)
8. Depth First Search (DFS)
9. Dijkstra - finding shortest path from given vertex
10. Kadane's algorithm
11. Cycle detection (using Floyd's Algorithm)
12. Sieve of Eratosthenes
13. Binary Exponentiation
14. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST - using Prim's, Kruskal's Algorithm)
15. Convex Hull
16. String matching (KMP, Rabin Karp)
17. Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)
18. Bipartite Check
