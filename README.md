## Data Structures and Algorithms from sratch

I am redoing everything from ground up. The purpose is to implement data structures in C and in the process learn to steer through the varied challenges and become a better programmer.

I will be writing (most) Data Structures in C and Algorithms in C++ using STL so that the algorithm can be used as a template later on.

This will serve as a reference material for me (and others).

### List of Data Structures:

**_1. Stack_**  
**_2. Queue_**  
**_3. Linked List_**  
**_4. Hash Table_**  
**_5. Binary Search Tree_**  
**_6. Binary Heap (heapify)_**  
**_7. Minimum stack / Minimum queue_**  
**_8. Fenwick Tree_**  
9. Segment Tree  
10. Disjoint-set (Union Find data structure)  
11. B-Tree  
12. B+ Tree  
13. Graph (using adjacency list)

### List of Algorithms:

**_1. Heapify (for binary heap)_**  
**_2. Preorder Traversal (in Binary Tree)_**  
**_3. Inorder Traversal (in Binary Tree)_**  
**_4. Postorder Traversal (in Binary Tree)_**  
**_5. Binary Search_**  
6. Level order Traversal (in Binary Tree, N-ary Tree)  
7. Breadth First Search (BFS)  
8. Depth First Search (DFS)  
9. Dijkstra - finding shortest path from given vertex  
10. Kadane's algorithm  
11. Cycle detection (using Floyd's Algorithm)  
12. Sieve of Eratosthenes  
13. Binary Exponentiation  
14. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST - using Prim's, Kruskal's Algorithm)  
15. Convex Hull  
16. String matching (KMP, Rabin Karp)  
17. Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)  
18. Bipartite Check  
19. Boyer-Moore majority vote algorithm
