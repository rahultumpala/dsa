Data Structures and Algorithms from sratch.

I am redoing everything from ground up. The purpose is to implement data structures in C and in the process learn to steer through the varied challenges and become a better programmer. 

I will be writing Data Structures in C and Algorithms in C++ (using STL for DataStructures so that algorithm can be used as a template later on).
 
This will serve as a reference material for me (and others).
